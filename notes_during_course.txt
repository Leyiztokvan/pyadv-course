# automate testing using github
# there is a a file called ci.yaml in .github/workflows folder
# check ci.yaml file, I added notes


# trying building the package manually in the terminal 
# with name: Build, we build the package
# if we build the package manually with "python -m build", then there will be a new folder "dist" created with the executable package that can be downloaded


# automating the deployement and building of the package using github actions
# we can automate this process usin github by using the github action "with: repository-url: https/test.pypi.org/legacy", as it is in here

# publish the package to PyPi
# create an test PyPi account and recovery codes and setup 2-factor authorations
# link the github repository to PyPi on https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing
